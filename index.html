                        <p>T127 is about getting hands-on experience creating learning materials while connecting what research says about learning. I chose AI in learning design because AI opens real opportunities to make learning more meaningful. Some of the challenges that I encountered during the leadership project could be overcome by using AI. When working with diverse groups of adult learners, made clear that learning materials and sessions need to actively construct mental models in learners. I believe most of those challenges could be addressed through thoughtful, AI-informed design. This project is my attempt to explore what that looks like in practice.</p>

                                    <p>The challenge: many participants still approached the programme as training that tells them what to do. We realized that simply putting people in groups and calling it "collaborative learning" isn't enough.

                                    <p>We tried to activate prior knowledge sessions began by asking leaders to map how they spend their time or describe a classroom observation. These helped surface existing mental models and created hooks for new concepts.</p>
                                    <p>Where we struggled was sequencing. Leadership is inherently complex, and for leaders who had never reflected on instructional leadership or used student data beyond exam results, we were asking them to analyze and evaluate before they understood. Looking back, it was jumping cognitive levels too quickly. Lengthy slide decks, overlapping models, and quick shifts between formats made overload worse especially for leaders working in a second language.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>Most leaders fell between novice and advanced beginner. Novice leaders rely on rules and directives when asked how they know learning is happening, they pointed to exam pass percentages. Advanced beginners recognized patterns. The competent group thought strategically.</p>
                                    <p>The assumption we made during design was that participants were at least competent, when many were novices. We designed for 'competent' practitioners while working mainly with novices and advanced beginners. Novice leaders filled planning templates with generic phrases for lack of mental models; meanwhile, experienced leaders found parts too basic.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Autonomy</strong> was largely absent leaders were nominated without consultation and attendance was mandatory. We created pockets of choice, but the framing of compulsion dominated. <strong>Competence</strong> was mixed: well-scaffolded modules gave leaders an "I can do this" moment, but overly abstract content left some overwhelmed. <strong>Relatedness</strong> had real strengths the residential format meant leaders lived and learned together, though hierarchies sometimes limited openness.</p>
                                    <p>But when sessions tapped intrinsic stories leaders who were concerned for marginalized students, proud to be the first graduate in their family became authentic. They discussed making classrooms joyful, supporting struggling learners beyond just pass rates.</p>

                                    <p>The programme sits within a culture where learning is transmission from authority. "Training" means experts lecturing, participants listening, then being tested. My instincts pushed in another direction I wanted discussion, questions, and learning built together. But openly going against the usual way of teaching would not have been accepted.</p>
                                    <p>So I stayed within the familiar format while gently changing it: short talks followed quickly by cases, using questions to surface ideas first. Deciding when to go along with these expectations and when to push back is still something I am figuring out.</p>

                                    <p>I overestimated leaders' readiness for abstract concepts. Because I was comfortable with "data-driven instruction" or "growth mindset," I assumed presenting these would be enough. I underestimated how much misalignment is possible where basic infrastructure is a daily struggle.</p>
                                    <p>I also underestimated the emotional work required. For a headteacher who built their identity around being a strict administrator, shifting towards collaborative leadership isn't just a technical change. They need space, safety, time and not just frameworks.</p>

                                    <p>Learner variability matters far more than I understood. Designing for an "average" participant means designing for no one. The Dreyfus model shows that differentiation is essential for meeting people where they are.</p>
                                    <p>This reflection has also clarified where I am in my own learning journey. I signed up with decent conceptual understanding but almost no practical wisdom about designing at system scale. The gap between understanding a theory and applying it in a messy, politically charged context is real and I am still learning how to hold theoretical integrity and political reality in large-scale projects.</p>

                    <p>Number systems beyond decimal feel abstract and disconnected from real-world computing. How do we help students understand The most fundamental challenge students face is the misconception that fractions and decimals are completely different types of numbers rather than different notations for representing the same quantities?</p>

                <div class="modal-section highlight">
                    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
                    <p><strong>Students will be able to understand:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>EQUIVALENCE</strong> Different fractions can represent the same quantity (equivalent fractions)</li>
                        <li><strong>FRACTION-DECIMAL CONNECTION</strong> The same quantity can be represented as a fraction or a decimal</li>
                        <li><strong>VISUAL PROOF</strong> Physical models (fraction strips) help us see and prove mathematical relationships</li>
                        <li><strong>MATHEMATICAL PATTERNS</strong> Predictable patterns exist in fraction-decimal relationships </li>

                    <h3>Pedagogical Approach</h3>
                    <p><strong>Concrete-to-Abstract Progression:</strong> Students start with visual fraction strips (concrete) before moving to symbolic notation (abstract), building conceptual understanding before procedural fluency.</p>
                    <p><strong>Multiple Representations:</strong> The same quantity appears simultaneously as a visual model (fraction strips), symbolic fraction, and decimal number reinforcing that these are different notations for the same mathematical idea.</p>
                    <p><strong>Discovery Through Interaction:</strong> Rather than being told "1/2 = 0.5," students physically manipulate fraction strips to discover equivalent fractions and their decimal representations, making abstract concepts tangible.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Interactive exploration reveals mathematical patterns (e.g., halving denominators, decimal equivalents) that build number sense rather than rote memorization.</p>

                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>An interactive fraction visualizer that lets students explore fraction equivalence and fraction-decimal relationships through manipulable fraction strips with instant visual feedback.</p>

                    <p class="learning-insight">The speed of iteration meant I could actually <em>try different approaches</em> and choose the one that best supported student understanding. This is the real power and not just faster coding, but faster learning design.</p>

                    <p>Negative numbers are abstract and hard for students to visualize. How do we make the concept of "below zero" concrete and spatially intuitive?</p>

                    <h3>Pedagogical Approach</h3>
                    <p><strong>Concrete-to-Abstract Progression:</strong> The space elevator metaphor provides a concrete, relatable model before introducing abstract numerical concepts. Students can "see" negative numbers as physical positions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Multiple Representations:</strong> By matching three different representations (numeral, visual, description), students build flexible mental models and deeper understanding of what negative numbers mean.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spatial Reasoning:</strong> Using vertical space (up/down) leverages students' intuitive understanding of physical height and depth, making abstract mathematics tangible.</p>
                    <p><strong>Active Discovery:</strong> Through gameplay, students discover patterns and relationships rather than being told rules, promoting constructivist learning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Immediate Feedback:</strong> Game mechanics provide instant feedback on matches, allowing students to self-correct and refine their understanding through iteration.</p>

                        "The game successfully balances fun gameplay with math learning. Students engage with prime numbers naturally through gameplay rather than feeling like they're doing homework."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="insight-text">This is the <strong>educator's expertise</strong> that AI cannot replace. Knowing the difference between a game that teaches and a game that distracts requires pedagogical judgment honed through experience.</p>
